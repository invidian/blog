Martin, Rich Hickey and others as well as various online articles. Part of my learning process was trying to adopt those practices and experiment with them to gain hands-on experience of their effect.
I started collecting links to those materials together with my own annotations in a Google Docs document, with a plan to use them as a reference to the practices I&amp;rsquo;m trying to cultivate during my work.</description></item></channel></rss>
